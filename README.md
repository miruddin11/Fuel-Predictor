## Project Overview
Fuel Efficiency Predictor is a web app designed to estimate the fuel efficiency of vehicles. It leverages a machine learning model trained on vehicle data to provide quick and accurate predictions. The app is user-friendly and accessible through a web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Features
- Predicts fuel efficiency with high accuracy.
- Easy-to-use web interface.
- Real-time predictions based on user input.
- Supports various vehicle attributes as input.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miruddin11/fuel-efficiency-predictor.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd fuel-efficiency-predictor
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
